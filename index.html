    <h2>How far have I come?</h2>
    <p>I have to say that when I started taking this course I did not know what to expect.  Compared to what I did in my previous life chapter, learning how to write HTML was what one my call a "gamble". 
        But so far I have figued out how to effectivly use the tools and resources that have been provided. To my suprise, I have come to enjoy writing these web pages and look forward
    to learning more indepth material.  Below are some learned techniques I apply before a "study sesson" as well as a few websites I find very useful.</p>
